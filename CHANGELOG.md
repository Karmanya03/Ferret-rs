### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed `fr dn` command to show output by default (was hiding everything)
- Improved error handling in file operations
- Better permission handling on Unix systems
- Fixed format warnings across all modules

### 🔒 Security & Privacy
- No telemetry or data collection
- All operations are local only
- Sensitive files excluded from version control
- Config files stored in standard OS locations

### 📝 Breaking Changes
**None!** This release is 100% backward compatible.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-18

### 🔥 Added - Pentesting & Security Features

#### New Commands
- **`fr ls`** - Enhanced directory listing command
  - Color-coded output (directories, executables, symlinks)
  - Long format support with permissions and sizes (like `ls -l`)

  - Recursive listing (like `ls -R`)
  - Show all files including hidden (like `ls -a`)
  - Optional permission explanations with `-e` flag
  - Works on both Unix and Windows
  - Flags: `-a` (all), `-l` (long), `-R` (recursive), `-H` (human-readable), `-e` (explain permissions)

- **`fr suid`** - Find SUID binaries (setuid - runs with owner privileges)
  - Essential for privilege escalation enumeration
  - Replaces: `find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null`
  - Flags: `-q` (quiet), `-v` (verbose), `-o` (output to file)

- **`fr sgid`** - Find SGID binaries (setgid - runs with group privileges)
  - Group-based privilege escalation vectors
  - Replaces: `find / -perm -2000 -type f 2>/dev/null`
